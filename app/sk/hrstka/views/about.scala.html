@main {O Hŕstke} {
    <p>Hŕstka was created from my need to find out where I can get a job if I want to live in Bratislava city and use
    Scala. I talked to friends, went to meetups and I've realized that there are many cool companies here that should be
    brought up to the light.</p>

    <h3>Looking for awesomeness</h3>
    <p>I'd like to bring up companies that a handful of well-chosen individuals think they are worth to work for. Hŕstka
    lists companies ordered by a rating based on:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Used technologies</li>
        <li>Overall tech profile</li>
        <li>Business with government</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html" rel="nofollow" title="The Joel Test">The Joel Test</a></li>
        <li>Female programmers count</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Technology profile</h3>
    <p>Every tech company should have a story here. List of used technologies is nice, but a well-written novelty is
    priceless. Ideally this technology profile is proudly used to attract new employees.</p>

    <h3>Open data, open source, open mind</h3>
    <p>Don't be shy. Contribute ideas, critics, opinions, information about companies, create pull requests. Spread the
    word, share the link. It will all get back to you.</p>
